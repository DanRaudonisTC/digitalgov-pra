## What is the PRA?

<p class="usa-font-lead">The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) is a law governing how federal agencies collect information from the American public. Important goals of the PRA include:</p>

### Managing information agencies request of the public

- We want to be good stewards of the public’s time, and not overwhelm them with unnecessary or duplicative requests for information.
- The PRA clearance process involves calculating burden hours. It’s important to understand how long it will take members of the public to complete your request.

### Making decisions based on high-quality data

- We want to make sure the data we collect is accurate, helpful, and a good fit for its proposed use.
- Part of the PRA process involves OIRA reviewing details about how the information you plan to collect fits with your goals.

### Protecting private information

- To respect privacy, we avoid asking for personal information that’s not relevant or necessary.
- The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) asks for extra detail if you’re collecting personally identifying information (PII)
